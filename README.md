# MicroForum (WiseCracks)
This is a collaborative effort for implementing a new startup idea for the class of Cloud Computing with group members as : Utkarsha S. , Janhavi B, Sagar S and Shweta S. It is a mobile application for people who want knowledge regarding the location where they stand getting involved in the forums of their interest. The event section allows to create and participate in different event the user wishes to participate. You can subscribe/unsubscribe to such events/forums depending on the location. We also have another feature called teleport which allows users to get knowledge about events happening in a different location of their choice. The project is developed and copyrighted by NYU Tandon School of Engineering students.
